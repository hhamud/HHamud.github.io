#+title: How to create a Clojure Monorepo


Suppose that you want to create a basic clojure monorepo without using large frameworks such as [[https://opensource.google/projects/bazel][Bazel]] or [[https://github.com/polyfy/polylith][Polylith]], then this is what you would do.

Assuming that you have a basic monorepo setup as so. /I've removed most
of the files typically associated in a clojure project setup for clarity
purposes/:

#+begin_src shell
.
|____deps.edn
|____modules
| |____lib1
| | |____deps.edn
| |____lib2
| | |____deps.edn
#+end_src

The root deps.edn file should have in its dependencies each library or
project referenced.

#+begin_src clojure
 :deps {modules/lib1 {:local/root "modules/lib3"}
        modules/lib3 {:local/root "modules/lib3"}}
#+end_src

Each library in your monorepo should include any of the local libraries
that it is using in its deps.edn file as shown in the below example.

#+begin_src clojure
 :deps { modules/lib1 {:local/root "../lib1"}
#+end_src

That is how you have a quick and basic clojure monorepo setup.
